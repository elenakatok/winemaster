/**
 * "Score & Record" — instructor-only, ALWAYS available, fully re-runnable.
 *
 * Every call does a complete recompute of the whole pool from the CURRENT group
 * outcomes (so post-finalize edits made via updateGroupContract are picked up,
 * because raw is re-derived from group.outcome — not read from stored raw_score)
 * and re-pushes the freshly computed set to the gradebook, overwriting in place.
 *
 * Deliberately DIFFERS from the shared finalizeInstance in exactly two ways:
 *   1. NO finalized_at early-return guard — every click recomputes, never re-pushes
 *      stale stored scores.
 *   2. NO "all groups complete" precondition — runs on current state anytime.
 *      Unresolved/unreported groups carry their floor: a member in a group whose
 *      outcome is null scores as walk-away (raw 0, in pool); a participant with no
 *      valid role / never matched gets the no-show floor (raw null, normalized -2,
 *      excluded from the pool). Both behaviours come straight from the existing
 *      engine pipeline (buildScoringRecord + computeZScoresByRole), unchanged.
 *
 * The recompute pipeline is pure and idempotent (z-score over current outcomes,
 * no accumulation), so repeated clicks with unchanged inputs yield identical grades.
 * Pushes the in-memory computed set (no re-read → no finalize→push visibility race).
 * Does NOT send instructor_adjusted_score, so the classroom's manual override
 * (nulled only on create, never on update) survives every re-push.
 *
 * This is a per-game callable (mirrors updateGroupContract) so it deploys without a
 * game-server release and never touches grays.
